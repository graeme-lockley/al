# Al

Al is, well, a language.

Al has the following features:

- indent based
- functional based, with side effects
- statically typed
- ADTs
- pattern matching
- exceptions
- garbage collected
- modules
- type inference
- closures

Well, for a start, it'll have the above features.  It will also be compiled using LLVM and will have a bootstrapped compiler.  The bootstrap compiler will be written in Java however the intention is that the first real Al program will be a compiler for Al.
